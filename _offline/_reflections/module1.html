<ul>
		<li>At what moment in class this week did you feel most engaged with what was happening?<br>
		<strong>When classmates began posting assignments and peer reviews. I have a feeling I'm working in the right direction when I can start viewing others work.</strong>		</li>
		<li>At what moment in class this week were you most distanced from what was happening?<br>
		<strong>None.</strong></li>
		<li>What action that anyone (teacher or student) took this weekend did you find most affirming or helpful?<br>
		<strong>The peer reviews are always helpful, from all.</strong>		</li>
		<li>What action that anyone took this weekend did you find most puzzling or confusing?<br>
		<strong>None.</strong>		</li>
		<li>What about the class this weekend surprised you the most? (This could be about your own reactions to what went on, something that someone did, or anything else that occurs).<br>
		<strong>Only one week for the Module! I guess I'm just used to having two weeks like last semester. Feel like I had to rush too much to really absord and fully understand everything I was doing.</strong>		</li>
