		<li>At what moment in class this week did you feel most engaged with what was happening?<br>
		<strong>Working on the CRUD application. Spent a good amount of time just trying different things and challenging myself to use a little JavaScript, jQuery and PHP to make this all work on one page. I ended up on a roll and completed all four elements of the CRUD.</strong></li>
		<li>At what moment in class this week were you most distanced from what was happening?<br>
		<strong>Creating the tutorial evidence pages.</strong></li>
		<li>What action that anyone (teacher or student) took this weekend did you find most affirming or helpful?<br>
		<strong>Kevin Anderson's kind words and flatery (in the form of imitation) on the phpMyAdmin assignment.</strong>		</li>
		<li>What action that anyone took this weekend did you find most puzzling or confusing?<br>
		<strong>N/A</strong></li>
		<li>What about the class this weekend surprised you the most? (This could be about your own reactions to what went on, something that someone did, or anything else that occurs).<br>
		<strong>How much easier it was for me to create this CRUD application. I didn't realize I could do that so quickly and easily. I surprised myself.</strong></li>
