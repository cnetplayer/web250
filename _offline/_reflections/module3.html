		<li>At what moment in class this week did you feel most engaged with what was happening?<br>
		<strong>When reading some of D.I.'s responses on the Discussion Forum.</strong></li>
		<li>At what moment in class this week were you most distanced from what was happening?<br>
		<strong>When trying to code form validations (not using PHP) while on cold medicine and suffering major cabin fever.</strong></li>
		<li>What action that anyone (teacher or student) took this weekend did you find most affirming or helpful?<br>
		<strong>Again, D.I.'s responses on the Discussion Forum.</strong>		</li>
		<li>What action that anyone took this weekend did you find most puzzling or confusing?<br>
		<strong>The large amount of JS and small amount of PHP this module. As noted by others though, I like the idea of combining these languages and exploring how it's all building together.</strong></li>
		<li>What about the class this weekend surprised you the most? (This could be about your own reactions to what went on, something that someone did, or anything else that occurs).<br>
		<strong>Slightly confusing activity instructions that has resulted in us all creating very different work examples. It's been nice to see the individual takes on the assignments though. Definitely enjoyed seeing each individual's creativity and problem solving.</strong></li>
